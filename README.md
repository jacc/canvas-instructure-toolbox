# ðŸ§° Canvas LMS Toolbox
### Some tools for students taking tests / quizzes on Canvas

> Most code was adapted from [@strix](https://github.com/strix/canvas-hack), however some scripts haven't been updated in 3+ years / didn't include specific features. All credits to him for the original code.

All of these scripts can be copy / pasted into the Developer Console (Inspect Element > Console)

`quizlet_exporter.js` - Allows you to export tests/quizzes/whatever in a copy-pasteable format to Quizlet
